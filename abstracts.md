### Homola, Jonathan. The Electoral Consequences of Separate Voting.
Separate voting is an institutional setting that has been argued to help marginalized groups participate more equally in the political process by having them cast their votes in different polling stations, different booths, or using clearly different ballot papers. However, there are no empirical studies on how it affects political behavior. Analyzing an original data set on gender-separated voting in Germany's Weimar Republic, I argue that the implementation of separate voting heightens the saliency of an individual's gender identity and leads to stronger conformity with respective group norms. This in turn suppresses participation such as turnout, especially in rural areas. The empirical analysis supports these predictions and is robust to a number of model specifications. The findings have implications for studies of equal participation and the design of electoral institutions.

### Homola, Jonathan, Jon C. Rogowski, Betsy Sinclair, Michelle Torres, and Patrick Tucker. Through the Ideology of the Beholder: Partisan Perceptions and Polarization Among the Mass Public. *Revise and Resubmit*.<a name="ideology"></a>
Recent scholarship uses insight from social identity theory to conceptualize partisanship as a social identity rooted in perceptions of partisan groups, but devotes less attention to understanding the causes and consequences of these perceptions. We argue that citizens' policy beliefs --- their operational ideologies --- shape their views of partisan groups in the contemporary United States. We report results from two nationally representative studies on the linkages between partisanship, ideology, and polarization. Data from two waves of a panel survey document exaggerated misperceptions of partisan group members and show that these exaggerations are strongly associated with ideological extremity. In a second study, an original survey experiment demonstrates that exaggerated partisan images, though not partisanship itself, significantly increase social polarization. Together, our results provide evidence about how ideological differences at the mass level fuel affective and social polarization.
