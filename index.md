Hi! I am Jonathan Homola, a fourth year graduate student in the Department of Political Science at [Washington University in St. Louis](http://polisci.wustl.edu/ "Washington University in St. Louis"). My broad research interests are in the areas of comparative politics and political methodology.


Before coming to St. Louis, I completed my undergraduate studies at [Freie Universität Berlin](http://www.polsoz.fu-berlin.de/en/polwiss/index.html "Freie Universität Berlin") in 2011, and obtained a Master's degree at the [University of Essex](http://www.essex.ac.uk/government/ "University of Essex") in 2013.
