Hi! I am Jonathan Homola, a fourth year graduate student in the Department of Political Science at <a href="http://polisci.wustl.edu/" target="_blank">Washington University in St. Louis</a>. My broad research interests are in the areas of comparative politics and political methodology.


Before coming to St. Louis, I completed my undergraduate studies at <a href="http://www.polsoz.fu-berlin.de/en/polwiss/index.html" target="_blank">Freie Universit√§t Berlin</a> in 2011, and obtained a Master's degree at the <a href="http://www.essex.ac.uk/government/" target="_blank">University of Essex</a> in 2013.
