<p align="justify">Hi! I am Jonathan Homola, a fourth year graduate student in the Department of Political Science at <a href="http://polisci.wustl.edu/" target="_blank">Washington University in St. Louis</a>. I am a comparativist and a political methodologist. My substantive research interests include party competition, representation, public opinion, and the role of women in politics. My regional areas of expertise are Western democracies and Eastern Europe. Methodologically, I am interested in Bayesian research methods, survival models, survey methodology, and causal inference.</p>

<p align="justify">Before coming to St. Louis, I completed my undergraduate studies at <a href="http://www.polsoz.fu-berlin.de/en/polwiss/index.html" target="_blank">Freie Universit√§t Berlin</a> in 2011, and obtained a Master's degree at the <a href="http://www.essex.ac.uk/government/" target="_blank">University of Essex</a> in 2013. In Spring 2018, I will be a visiting student at <a href="https://gov.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Harvard University</a> and a pre-doctoral research fellow at the <a href="https://www.iq.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">IQSS</a>.</p>
