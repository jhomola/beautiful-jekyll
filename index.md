<p align="justify">Hi! I am Jonathan Homola, a fourth year graduate student in the Department of Political Science at <a href="http://polisci.wustl.edu/" target="_blank">Washington University in St. Louis</a>. I am a political methodologist and a comparativist. My substantive research interests include party competition, representation, political behavior, and the role of women in politics. My regional areas of expertise are Western democracies and Eastern Europe. Methodologically, I am interested in Bayesian research methods, survival models, survey methodology, and causal inference. My work across these different fields has lead to multiple <a href="http://jhomola.com/research">publications</a> including papers in the Journal of Politics, Political Analysis, the British Journal of Political Science, Comparative Political Studies, and Electoral Studies.</p>

<p align="justify">My dissertation is motivated by the persistence of gender differences in most stages of the political process. Across the different papers, I analyze and uncover differences between women and men in terms of (i) how group stereotypes affect their political participation, (ii) how parties differ in the responsiveness to their preferences, and (iii) how gender affects the survival in office of individual ministers.</p>

<p align="justify">Before coming to St. Louis, I completed my undergraduate studies at <a href="http://www.polsoz.fu-berlin.de/en/polwiss/index.html" target="_blank">Freie Universit√§t Berlin</a> in 2011, and obtained a Master's degree at the <a href="http://www.essex.ac.uk/government/" target="_blank">University of Essex</a> in 2013. In Spring 2018, I will be a visiting student at <a href="https://gov.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Harvard University</a> and a pre-doctoral research fellow at the <a href="https://www.iq.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">IQSS</a>.</p>
